# ExRe-WaLl
Pass through the wall, connect the imaginary world  with your hand.
# The Concept
  In this project, we were inspired by the US game show Hole in the wall and we foresee a gaming problem where some players want to experience a VR-like experience by controlling in real life. But due to the high cost of VR and the game that can control the character size in real-time by controlling in real life with a hand without gadgets never has been. So we combine inspiration. Combined with the ultimate VR-like experience, that players will receive from playing this game without using VR.
This is a game where a wall with gaps is a random pose. At the beginning of the game, the wall will push toward the player to push him down from the map and the player will be a character without a pose and then There will be a menu bar below. by random pose and let the player drag that poses onto the surface To make a pose to match the posture of the wall within the time limit where the proportions of the characters must fit with a gap in the wall and have a position that matches the wall, By controlling the game, it uses AI to perform pose gestures by spreading hands in and out to reduce the size of the player character and expand the scope of the player character in real-time. to make the player character size fit with the space of the wall to pass the checkpoint and use the hand to drag the pose to put on the character and use the hand to perform rotate position and the angle of the posture to make the pose fit with the posture on the wall.
